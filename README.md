# Overview : Lab 11 PDQ Inventory: Hardware and Software Reporting
This repository documents my home lab focused on PDQ Inventory: Hardware and Software Reporting using VirtualBox. The lab aims to explore PDQ Inventory's capabilities for gathering detailed reports on hardware and software configurations across a network of virtual machines. The project will include setting up PDQ Inventory, creating custom reports, and automating hardware/software data collection for system management and network monitoring.

## Objectives
- Learn PDQ Inventory: Explore how to set up PDQ Inventory and configure it for comprehensive hardware and software reporting.
- Create Custom Reports: Learn how to build and customize reports to track hardware specifications, software installations, and system configurations.

## Documentation
In this home lab, I will showcase the installation and uses of PDQ Inventory. To start, open File Explorer and navigate to the SimoTech folder. Inside, you should find the PDQ Inventory application.
